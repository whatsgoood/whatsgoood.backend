# WhatsGoood backend Project

This repo serves as the backend(REST API) repo for the WhatsGoood web application. 

## Description

The main component of the backend is a python-flask rest Api service.
Json data can be retrieved from a cloud mongodb, which is then processed to output ratings for a list of supported 
sports. Ratings are generated by applying preconfigured sport-specific weights to live or forecasted weather data.

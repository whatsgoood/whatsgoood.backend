Frontend:
  - Idea:
    - Traffic light system for activities
    - All highly rated activities at the top in green
    - lower ratings in yellow and red 
    - calls to API for list of json objects detailing the rating and reasoning behind the rating

 - Cards:
    - robot themed(red, yellow, green) color coding based on rating of activity
    - icon of activity
    - onHover shows info about the weather and reasoning behind the decision


Backend: 

 - Rating model:
    - each sports ratings are base on weights of each of the parameters in the weather.
        eg. wind is weighted highly for kiting, but temparature is rated higher for climbing.
    

new rating(wind, wave, weather)

sport surfing = new rating(2, 6, 2);
